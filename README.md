# FreeCodeCamp Celestial Bodies Project

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and focuses on creating tables, adding primary and foreign keys, and inserting data about celestial objects using PostgreSQL.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

- `planet`: Stores information about different planets.
- `moon`: Stores information about moons orbiting the planets.
- `star`: Stores information about stars.
- `galaxy`: Stores information about galaxies.

Each table has primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between the entities.
